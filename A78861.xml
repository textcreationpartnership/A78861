            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Whereas there hath been lately an Insurrection and Rebellion against Vs in Our County of <hi>Glocester,</hi> which hath so generally possessed the Spirits of that County (though We doe acknowledge many Gentlemen of the best quality there, have with Courage retained their Loyalty to Vs, and have suffered with Vs, which We shall alwayes and particularly remember) that there hath been a greater concurrence there in this
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:172784:3"/>desperate Rebellion then in any County of England, insomuch that We have been compelled to send a considerable part of Our Army thither, the which it pleased God to blesse with such Successe, that We hope for the future We shall be able, by the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Assistance of You, and the rest of Our good Subjects of that County, to preserve you from the like Invasions. And to shew how farre We are from the just Sense and Indignation We might well enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine against those, who have so wilfully fallen from their Allegiance, or concurred with the disloyalty of others, by not applying themselves to a timely prevention, We have sent Our gratious Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to inhibite Our Souldiers from plundring, or using any violence to any of Our Subjects of that County, of what condition soever, and to secure them in the freedome of their Markets, that their Trade and Commerce may be renewed and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Yet We must Declare unto you, that We expect some reparation, and an exemplar testimony of th eir conversion and Affection, who neglecting Our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Proclamations of Grace and Pardon, continued still to foment this unnaturall bloody dissention, though We shall not proceed with strictnesse and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity against them; And it will not seeme just that the Charge and Burthen, brought upon the Country by the malice and connivence of such Men, should be equally borne by those who have faithfully adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their Loyalty and Affection to Vs, which is the Case in the Rate for the monethly Contribution agreed upon, in which all Persons of ability are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172784:3"/>engaged, how different soever their Demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour hath been; And therefore Our Pleasure is, That you, or any three of you (whereof We appoint you Our high Sheriffe to be one) call and summon together the Gentlemen, Clergy and substantiall Freeholders and Inhabitants of that Our County, to appeare before you at such times and places as you shall thinke most convenient, and move them in Out Name freely to assist and Contribute unto Vs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their severall abilities, in these Our urgent, and important occasions, for the maintenance of the true Protestant Religion, in which they been bred, for the defence of the Lawes and Liberties to which they were borne, and for the safety of Our Person to which they have so often sworne; and as We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, all well-affected Persons will be willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy upon this occasion to expresse their Duty to Vs, so We doubt not such, who have by weaknesse and misunderstanding, or through feare and apprehension of danger been so farre transported, as to contribute or consent to these horrid dissentions, will by then free and liberall Assistance of Vs, expresse, That their former Errors proceeded from weaknesse, not from malice. And Our Pleasure is, and We doe hereby authorize you Our high Sheriffe to receive all such summes of Money as shall be contributed unto Vs, and with the advice of the Iustices of the Peace, who shall assist you in this Service, to returne the names of all such who shall expresse their Affections to Us this way, as likewise of those whose stubbornesse and perversenesse may, in you: Opinion, have an ill Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>nce upon the Peace and quiet of the County. And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172784:4"/>you shall further require all the Trained-Bands of that Our County, to send in their Armes they have been charged with, to Our Magazine at <hi>Cyrencester,</hi> within tenne daies after the date of this Our Letter, at their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most perill: and if any men shall excuse themselves by laying, that their Armes are already delivered in at <hi>Glocester</hi> or <hi>Cyrencester,</hi> or any other place, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they cannot obey Vs herein, you shall let them know, that We will not consent that their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to obey those commands which tended to the disturbance of the Peace of that Our County, shall be any excuse for their not obeying Ours, which are for their necessary defence and safety, and therefore We shall expect that every person, within that Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who is charg'd with Armes, or hath found Armes by vertue of the pretended Ordinance of the <hi>Militia,</hi> shall within the time prefixed deliver the Armes with which he is Charged, and such who executed the <hi>Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> all their Armes into Our said Magazine, except such Persons who shall sufficiently make proof before you, That their Armes were by Force and Violence taken from them by the said Rebells, and of this you shall give Us a particular Account, that We well knowing the number of Armes that Our County stands char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with, and with which private Persons have late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furnished themselves, may judge of their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by their Obedience to these Commands. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because the City of <hi>Glocester,</hi> notwithstanding Our gratious Proclamation and offer of Pardon, doth yet refuse to yeeld that submission and obedience which is due to Us, whereby We may be compelled to visit those parts with Our Army, which might else be free
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172784:4"/>from those inconveniences, We straitly Will and Command all Our loving Subjects of that Our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to forbear, and not to entertain any Commerce or Traffique with Our said Citty of Glocester, neither by buying or selling, or any other offices of Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, till the same shall returne to it's Loyalty and Subjection; which if it shall doe, We shall receive it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Our Protection, and defend it from any Assaults or violence. And you shall cause these Our Letters to be publiquely read in all the Churches and Chappels of that Our County, that all Our Subjects may know the contents thereof, and conforme themselves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
